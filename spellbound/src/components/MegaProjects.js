          How Mega-Infrastructure Projects Will Power Bangladeshâ€™s Economic

          Bangladesh is focused on infrastructure to attract investment and
          supercharge economic growth. With megaprojects set to improve
          transport, shipping, communication and energy, the stage is set for a
          bright future.

          Spanning more than six kilometers (3.7 miles) and linking the
          southwest of the country to the north and east, the Padma Multipurpose
          Bridge is a symbol of how far Bangladesh has come as a nation and of
          its ambition for the future. The double-decker steel structure, which
          is due to open this year, was built to withstand monsoons, flooding
          and earthquakes. It will carry rail and road vehicles over the Padma
          River, as well as utilities including gas pipes and telecommunication
          lines, opening avenues for trade and boosting economic growth.
