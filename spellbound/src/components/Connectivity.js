            Bangladesh Vision 2041, a national strategic plan to accelerate the
            country's socio-economic growth, cites stronger and better-quality
            infrastructure as a core need, seeing opportunities for significant
            investment in areas like ports, roads and transportation, where
            Bangladesh lags other similar-stage Asian economies. To fuel the
            country's rapid economic growth, Bangladesh is transforming its
            infrastructure through mega projects spanning new ports, rail links
            and bridges. The Asian Development Bank notes that increasing
            capital flows is critical to improving the competitiveness of
            domestic industries and overall economic efficiency â€“ and Bangladesh
            is doing just that.

          The government is addressing the need for quality infrastructure, in
          particular transport infrastructure, with sustained investments and
          public-private partnerships that will help fill funding needs of
          around $10 billion a year. Key projects will boost trade, industry,
          transport and energy capacity, fueling Bangladesh's rise to
          high-income status.
